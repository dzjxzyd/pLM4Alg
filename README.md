# pLM4Allergen
Allergenic protein or peptide prediction based on protein language model (ESM-2)

### Explaination of the datast
Allergenic sequences were labeled as 0 (positive) and non-allergenic sequence were labeled as 1 (negative). The dataset used in this study was compiled from four known public databases: CAMPARE, AllergenOnline, IUIS, and Uniprot. Datamining was used for AllergenOnline and IUIS (you can use our code for your latest dataset retrival).
